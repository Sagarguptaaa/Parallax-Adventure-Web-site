          People who are drawn to thrill-seeking activities have a high
          tolerance for uncertainty, says Farley. They enjoy engaging with
          unfamiliar things, are innately curious about the world, and
          creatively adapt to change instead of being fearful of it. To nurture
          this quality in yourself, seek out situations that feel adventurous to
          you, whether that's taking a drawing class online or signing up for a
          workout you've never done, he says. Afterward, cement the experience
          in your mind by thinking about what you gained from it: meeting new
          people, learning a skill, pushing past your trepidation. Considering
          the ways you've successfully taken chances will help you see yourself
          as a more adventurous person, which can make you more courageous in
          the future

          Participating in an adrenaline-pumping physical activity can lead to
          higher levels of what experts call self-efficacy, or a belief in your
          abilities, research shows. Other types of adventure—running for public
          office, doing improv at your local comedy club, taking virtual singing
          lessons—build your confidence too, says Farley. The more you push past
          your comfort zone and feel proud of yourself for doing so, the more
          confident you'll become.

          To be fit and healthy you need to be physically active. Regular
          physical activity can help protect you from serious diseases such as
          obesity, heart disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and
          arthritis. Riding your bicycle regularly is one of the best ways to
          reduce your risk of health problems associated with a sedentary
          lifestyle. Cycling is a healthy, low-impact exercise that can be
          enjoyed by people of all ages, from young children to older adults. It
          is also fun, cheap and good for the environment. Riding to work or the
          shops is one of the most time-efficient ways to combine regular
          exercise with your everyday routine. An estimated one billion people
          ride bicycles every day for transport, recreation and sport.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cycling is a good way to control or reduce weight, as it raises your
          metabolic rate, builds muscle and burns body fat. If you re trying to
          lose weight, cycling must be combined with a healthy eating plan.
          Cycling is a comfortable form of exercise and you can change the time
          and intensity it can be built up slowly and varied to suit you.
          Research suggests you should be burning at least 8,400 kilojoules
          (about 2,000 calories) a week through exercise. Steady cycling burns
          about 1,200 kilojoules (about 300 calories) per hour.

          You may have seen birds fly in the air, and thought to yourself, “I
          wish I could do the same.” Yes, no one can sprout wings and soar
          across the sky like those birds, but it is entirely possible to get in
          the air through paragliding. As a competitive and recreational
          activity, paragliding enables you to get suspended above the earth.
          Not only is the sport a favourite among those on vacation, but it also
          comes with tons of health benefits, both mentally and physically.
          <br />
          <br />
          Paragliding is a great sport for both young and old. However, it is
          not the cup of tea for everyone, since there are people who find the
          sport to be intimidating. Others don t give it a shot at all, because
          they fear the heights involved. That said, the crux of the matter is,
          that paragliding can help this group of people to overcome their
          fears. Once a person experiences how easy, relaxing, and exciting the
          sport is, their concerns will automatically go away. Getting that
          initial confidence boost will play a key role in helping a person take
          their skills to the next level.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is not as easy as it looks. It is worth taking some lessons to
          give you the basics and hopefully get you up on your feet. As surfing
          involves the ocean, you should be a strong swimmer and always be aware
          of the safety aspects of being in the surf. If you are not sure about
          a suitable surfing spot, ask the local lifesavers or surfshop. Having
          the right equipment is essential to get the best out of the surf. Your
          board should suit your body and your ability. For example, start with
          a long board as they are easier to stand up on, paddle and ride. Wear
          a wetsuit if necessary to keep you in the water long enough to learn
          <br />
          <br />
          Stand up paddling (SUP) brings together the skills of long boarding
          and paddling in a very dynamic way. Stand up paddlers stand on a board
          and use a long paddle to move through the water. SUP boards have
          dimensions that are much larger than the everyday surfboard or long
          board and so the techniques to ride this equipment vary from it. Using
          the paddle adds another dimension to your surfing experience. As SUP
          is a new and developing discipline of surfing, the physical aspects to
          long-term participation are unknown at this stage.The health benefits
          and safety precautions are similar to surfing and long boarding, but
          SUP riders need to be aware that their equipment is larger and more
          dangerous to others in the surf.
